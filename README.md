# ChemHealth

ChemHealth is a web-based computational chemistry and machine learning platform designed to analyze medications, hormones, and supplements related to women’s health.

The project investigates how molecular structure, bonding, and intermolecular forces influence chemical properties such as solubility, stability, and absorption using computer-based modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

ChemHealth integrates software engineering, data science, and computational chemistry to provide a platform for chemical property analysis and visualization.

The system allows users to explore molecular datasets, run predictive models, and interpret results through an interactive web interface.

This project is developed as an end-to-end system, following modern software engineering and DevOps practices.

## Motivation

This project was created to combine my interests in software engineering, data analysis, and science within an important healthcare domain.

It provides hands-on experience in:

- Full-stack development
- Machine learning integration
- Data engineering
- System architecture
- Cloud and DevOps practices

ChemHealth also serves as a portfolio project demonstrating real-world system design and implementation.

## Academic Relevance

This project supports the following learning objectives:

- Learning Goal 2: Understanding how molecular bonding determines three-dimensional molecular structure
- Learning Goal 3: Analyzing how intermolecular interactions relate to energy changes

Research is based on literature review and computational analysis rather than physical experimentation.

## System Architecture

ChemHealth follows a modular, scalable architecture:

- Frontend: Web-based user interface
- Backend: API and business logic
- Machine Learning: Prediction and analysis engine
- Database: Chemical dataset storage
- Infrastructure: Containerized deployment

# Phase 1 Diagrams

These diagrams provide a high-level view of the ChemHealth system,
focusing on system context, data flow, user interaction, and logical components.

They intentionally avoid implementation and infrastructure details,
which are addressed in later phases.
