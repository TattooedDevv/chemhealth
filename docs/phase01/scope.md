# Project Scope

## Overview

ChemHealth is a web-based computational chemistry and machine learning platform designed to analyze medications, hormones, and supplements related to women’s health.

The project focuses on investigating how molecular structure, bonding, and intermolecular forces influence properties such as solubility, stability, and absorption. These relationships are analyzed using computer-based modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- Analyze molecular datasets related to women’s health
- Study the effects of chemical bonding on biological behavior
- Apply machine learning models for property prediction
- Provide interactive visualizations of chemical data
- Support future cloud-based deployment

## Academic Alignment

This project supports Learning Goal 2 by examining how molecular bonding determines three-dimensional molecular structure.

It supports Learning Goal 3 by analyzing how intermolecular interactions relate to energy changes and chemical properties.

Research is conducted through literature review and computational analysis rather than physical experimentation.
